| November 18 | 0115-0145 | The pattern I detected is that there are usually long strings of either 1 or 0. I am using a byte code which stores in the first bit what to write and in the next 7 bits how many times to write it. In order to detect change I have two booleans to keep track of what the streak is of and the current bit. I am also making sure I dont go over the bit limit |

Then for that amount of time write the type out. I am encountering an error with infinite loops that I can't debug |
