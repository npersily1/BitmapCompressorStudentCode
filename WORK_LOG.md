I am using a byte code which stores in the first bit what to write and in the next 7 bits how many times to write it. In order to detect change I have two booleans to keep track of what the streak is of and the current bit. I am also making sure I do not go over the bit limit |

Then for that amount of time write the type out. I am encountering an error with infinite loops that I can't debug |

I determined that the issue with repeating is in the BinaryStdIn class specifically in the fill buffer method. More specifically in th line buffer = in.read();. I do not know how to progress from here |
| November 20 | 1120-1150 | I realized the configuration was messing up my debugging, I started running it again in the terminal. I switched from nested while loops and having a byte code to just one while loop with many if statements. My main problem was I wasn't resetting count and I was inconsistently reading bits in. Instead of byte codes, I write things out sequentially so I just write the type then the number no need for the intermediary byte. |
